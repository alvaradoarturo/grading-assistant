Designed and built for my AP Computer Science A classes

## Compiling 
To support dynamic grading of student-submitted `.java` files, this project uses the `JavaCompiler` API from `javax.tools`. This allows the system to:

- **Compile student code programmatically** without invoking `javac` manually.
- **Catch and report compilation errors gracefully**, so that failed compilation doesn't break the grading pipeline.
- **Enable runtime execution of unit tests** (e.g., via JUnit) **only if compilation is successful**.

## Parsing
This project uses the JavaParser library to transform raw Java source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for static analysis.

### Analyzers
The following analyzers are currently implemented in the Grading Assistant:

| Analyzer       | Description                                                                                  | Example Use Case                                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LoopAnalyzer**       | Checks for loop usage, specific loop types (`for`, `while`), bounds correctness, and more.      | Verify student loops from index `0` to `array.length - 1`.          |
| **MethodCallAnalyzer**| Detects presence or absence of required method calls, forbidden method usage, and call context. | Ensure a student calls `simulate()` inside a loop or conditional.   |
| **ArrayAnalyzer**     | Verifies array declaration, initialization, and traversal (including enhanced `for` loops).      | Check that `allQuestions` is properly declared and fully traversed. |
| **ClassAnalyzer**     | Verifies class declaration, instance variables, constructors, and method signatures.      |  |

Each analyzer is **configurable per lab**, allowing for flexible grading of various AP CSA FRQ-style problems.
